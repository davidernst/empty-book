How can we produce this material quicker and at lower cost? Will this product harm us or help us? All of these questions can be answered using the science of<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><strong>chemistry</strong>.</p><h2>What is Chemistry?</h2><p id="x-ck12-MWJkOGJjZDY3MWRlYzcxZjgxODNlZTNkNzNlYTBlMWQ.-qen">If we look up the word “chemistry” in the dictionary, we’ll find something like this: “The science of the composition, structure, properties, and reactions of<strong>matter</strong>, especially of atomic and molecular systems” (Free Online Dictionary). This definition is certainly accurate, but does not give a good picture of the scope of chemistry or of the many interesting aspects of the field.</p><p id="x-ck12-YTQzNmU3ZDk4MjMwYjliMDBmODJmYTFlODkwZDBjZWM.-kcz">Chemistry touches every area of our lives. The medicines we take, the food we eat, the clothes we wear – all these materials and more are, in some way or another, products of chemistry.</p><h2>What is the World Made of?</h2><p id="x-ck12-MWExOGE2YTRlNzY5MjgzMDk1NmI2YzkxMTgwZmQzZGU.-r2k">Questions about matter have been asked for centuries.&nbsp; The ancient Greek philosophes spent a lot of time trying to figure out what matter was.&nbsp; Different philosophers debated whether matter was earth, water, air, fire, or some combination.&nbsp; They argued, but did not do any experiments at that time.</p><p id="x-ck12-ZmY3NWM4MmU3NDdhNDE3ZGMzODc1N2I3MjMwNmU3NzY.-ruj">It took many centuries for humans to develop a better concept of what matter really is.&nbsp; Even today, we have an incomplete picture of exactly what this stuff is that we can touch and see.&nbsp; Chemistry involves the study of these substances, both in terms of basic properties and also learning all the things we can do with matter.</p><p id="x-ck12-Y2RhYzE2MzNiN2JlYTBkMTg0MzFjM2IxNGMyYWY3NTA.-fux">Chemists look at the world in two ways, often simultaneously.&nbsp; The two worlds of the chemist are the<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><strong>macroscopic</strong><span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>world and the<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><strong>microscopic</strong><span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>world.&nbsp; Macroscopic refers to substances and objects that can be seen, touched, and measured directly.&nbsp; Microscopic refers to the small particles that make up all matter.&nbsp; Chemists must observe matter and do experiments macroscopically and then make generalizations and propose explanations that are microscopic in nature.&nbsp; For example, anyone can observe the physical change in appearance that occurs as an iron object such as a tractor that is left out in the elements gradually turns to rust.&nbsp; However, a chemist looks at the rusting tractor and thinks about what is going on with the individual atoms that make up the iron and how they are changing as a result of exposure to oxygen in the air and water from rain.&nbsp; Throughout your study of chemistry, you will often switch back and forth between the macroscopic and microscopic worlds.</p><div id="x-ck12-NzBhNDk5N2QyZDUxODNhYjU1ZGU5YWMzNTRjNDllMjE.-jrt" class="x-ck12-img-postcard x-ck12-nofloat"><p id="x-ck12-hf5"><img src="http://www.ck12.org/flx/show/THUMB_POSTCARD/image/user%3AY2sxMnNjaWVuY2VAY2sxMi5vcmc./98045-1358452890-95-59-C-IntCh-01-01-01-Artillery-Shells.jpg" id="x-ck12-OTgwNDUtMTM1ODQ1Mjg5MC05NS01OS1DLUludENoLTAxLTAxLTAxLUFydGlsbGVyeS1TaGVsbHM." alt="" longdesc="http://www.ck12.org/user:ZGVybnN0QHVtbi5lZHU./book/Daves-Flexbook/r2/section/2.0/Rusting%20artillery%20shells."></p><p id="x-ck12-ZjEzYTM0YjQ2ZWJlYjYzM2Q4OGQ5N2MwYjM2ZjcyNjM.-g1a">Rusting artillery shells.</p></div><div class="example" data-type="activity"><span class="title"></span><p><meta charset="utf-8" style=""></p><p></p><ol id="x-ck12-OWQxYWYwNTc2M2ZjODdhMzJiMzg4YjhjZGM2M2ZmYzU.-lj8"><li>Read the label on a prepared food product (for example: bread, cereal, dessert).
